        <h1>Pop Culture Moments</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <p> The term pop culture gets thrown around a lot, but do you know what it actually means? Pop culture refers to popular culture which is aimed at the younger generation and transmitted via the mass media. Popular culture is essentially a set of beliefs, values, actions, objects, or goods and practices that are popular at any given time and space in society. It can refer to things like art, literature, fashion, dance, film, television, magazines and ways of living to name a few.</p>

        <p >Rihanna graces the Super Bowl:This is my Super Bowl” will take on new meaning with Bad Gal Riri’s half-time performance at the very big football game on February 12. It’ll be her first live appearance since 2018 (that was at the Grammys and of course she slayed), with rumours – or hopes from fans like us – that it’s a precursor to a new era or album.</p>
